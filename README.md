**Recommendation Models** 
A recommender system predicts the rating value of a user-item combination with an assumption that the training data available indicates a user’s preference for other items.
We use the user-item Interaction Data, such as ratings and apply various modelling techniques that uses collaborative filtering to predict user’s preference.<br>
We have executed 2 Recommendation models<br>
1. SVD- Surprise Singular Value Decomposition<br>
2. NCF<br>
We have computed the evaluation metrics of both these models<br>
Based on the predicted ratings we recommended popular items to a particular user.<br>


**Similarity Search Model**
Users can find the products they are looking for using the Search feature<br>
The search feature also lists the products similar to the items being searched<br>
