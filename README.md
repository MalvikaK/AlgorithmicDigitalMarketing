**Analytics Dashboard**




























**Recommendation Models** 
A recommender system predicts the rating value of a user-item combination with an assumption that the training data available indicates a user’s preference for other items.
We use the user-item Interaction Data, such as ratings and apply various modelling techniques that uses collaborative filtering to predict user’s preference.
We have executed 2 Recommendation models
1. SVD- Surprise Singular Value Decomposition
2. NCF
We have computed the evaluation metrics of both these models
Based on the predicted ratings we recommended popular items to a particular user.


**Similarity Search Model**
Users can find the products they are looking for using the Search feature
The search feature also lists the products similar to the items being searched
